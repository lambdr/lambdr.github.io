These are a collection of projects I have worked on during the course of my master's program.

### UFO Visualization
I worked with other M.S. Biostatistics students to create [a website](https://nishalingam.github.io/p8105_final-project/index.html) that explores and analyzes reports of UFO sightings. We used data collected by the [NUFORC](https://nuforc.org/) and adapted by [Timothy Renner](https://data.world/timothyrenner) for this project. If you are interested, our [report](https://nishalingam.github.io/p8105_final-project/report.html) summarizes these findings.

### Breast Cancer Survival

For my final project in Biostatistical Methods 1, I collaborated with two other students to predict risk of death in patients with breast cancer. We built and optimized a logistic regression model and evaluated its performance on different racial groups. Our report is available [here](files/p8130_written_report.pdf).

The stripes are colored yellow if the patient survived, and red if they died. The black line indicates the predicted probability of death.</p>


### Interactive NOAA Dashboard

I made [this dashboard](dashboard.html) as part of my data science course at Mailman. It pulls data from weather stations across the state of New York and displays various pieces of information using the `plotly` and `leaflet` libraries.
