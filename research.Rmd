### Research Experience

My first research experience was with the Hernández Sánchez group at the University of Pittsburg. There, I worked on the synthesis of radially oriented [n]cyclo-*meta*-phenylenes, and gained proficiency research skills such as chromatography and NMR analyses.

Following graduation, I joined the Buehler Lab at the [Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cboth/) (CBOTH). During my time there I worked on an array of studies, from sickle cell and COVID-based coagulopathies to drug induced hemolysis. I developed laboratory methods, such as an assay for the generation of methemoglobin in response to oxidative insult and worked to refine existing methods on HPLC separation of modified hemoglobins. I also worked on the logistics of study design and implementation, including the initiation of a clinical study of cardiopulmonary bypass related hemolysis. Much of my work concerned the development of polymerized hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and their evaluation *in vivo*.

During my time at CBOTH, I realized that while I had an interest in researching disease outcomes and hemorrhage therapeutics, it lay more with the public health impact of these issues, and that I had a growing interest in developing statistical methodology. For those reasons, I left CBOTH and decided to pursue an M.S. at Columbia Mailman. My full resume can be found [here](files/Lamb_Resume.pdf).
